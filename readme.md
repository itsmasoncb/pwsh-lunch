PowerShell Scripts learned through a variety of sources:
- PowerShell in a Month of Lunches, 4th Edition.
- Through necessity and creativity.
- Edits made to found Scripts via work or the internet.

Most sources list documentation for where anything has been pulled from and notes explaining the usage of the scripts.
